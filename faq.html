    <h2 class="animation fadeInUp">In case you're curious...</h2>
    <p class="animation delay1 fadeInUp">We've tried to provide some more details about our wedding weekend below.  If you have any questions, please <a href="mailto:yogiandathma@gmail.com?Subject=Wedding%20Question" target="_top">e-mail</a> us! 
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> <strong>Q: What should I wear?</strong> <br> A: We recommend semi-formal or formal attire. Vibrancy in colors and extravagance in accessories are encouraged. For women considering their shoe choices, there will be minimal grass area that can be avoided if necessary. If you would like to don traditional Indian attire, please let us know as we can provide suggestions and recommendations. </p>
    <br>
    <p> <strong>Q: Where will the wedding take place? </strong> <br> A: The ceremony will occur outdoors under the Washburn Pavilion at the Museum of Science, Boston, MA. Dinner will be in a tent adjacent to the pavilion and dancing will occur at an undisclosed location nearby. <br> Note that there is a chance of chill, especially near the water at night, so consider bringing a wrap of some kind. </p>
    <br>
    <p> <strong> Q: Is there a risk of drowning? </strong> <br> A: We are not permitted to enter the water (although the water is rated safe for swimming after much environmental remediation over the last two decades) and there is a railing to prevent accidental water incursions due to inebriation. Please watch out for the astray child. </p>
    <br>
    <p> <strong> Q: What food will be served? </strong> <br> A: Dinner will be consist of a lavish assortment of dishes native to the Subcontinent. Indeed, vegetarian and vegan options will feature prominently on the menu. Please inform us of any additional dietary preferences/restrictions. For those fond of capsaicin, an assortment of spicy condiments will be on hand. </p>
    <br>
    <p> <strong> Q: Should I bring a gift? </strong> <br>A: No. Please do not bring gifts (We already have too many toys). Your presence is a gift unto itself. However, donations to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwqWbfK9TXA">The Human Fund</a> are encouraged. <i>"The Human Fund - Money For People"</i> - George Constanza </p>
    <br>
    <p> <strong> Q: When should I arrive? </strong> <br> A: Please arrive at 5:00 PM EDT. This corresponds to 4:00 PM IST. </p>
